        <p>Zenreach helps time-pressed small businesses bring customers back through WiFi Marketing.</p>
        <p>When I joined Zenreach, their existing visual identity was a patchwork of one-off designs created by an array of designers (and others) over the previous years. There were some loose visual themes, but there was no explicit identity documentation and no unified vision for the company’s mission and values.</p>
        <p>Everyone was well-aware of the problems that came with this: It was the Wild West. Every salesperson seemed to have a different pitch and their own self-managed ecosystem of collateral. Every team seemed to have a different understanding of who the target customer was and what we were building for them.<br></p>
        <p>Both internally and externally, there was very little brand equity.<br></p>

    <p>One of my first priorities was to work with the marketing and sales teams to audit the company’s vast collateral ecosystem. I worked with the Director of Marketing to catalog every asset, archive the outdated stuff, consolidate the redundant stuff and systematize the marketing copy we were using.</p>
    <p>We delivered our newly built marketing library to <a href="https://redantler.com/">Red Antler</a>, who had been hired to provide creative direction and logo design for a new identity. From there, they began their discovery process and led conversations with the Executive team to help articulate a mission statement and core values.</p>

    <p>As a mid-stage startup, Zenreach faced some difficult messaging challenges. The long-term product roadmap was undecided, so we needed to build an identity that was flexible enough to adapt to changing landscapes but still confident enough to differentiate Zenreach from the other companies in its space. We knew that Food &amp; Beverage customers were going to remain our bread and butter, but within that industry we might be selling to owner-operators, franchisees or the VP of Marketing for national restaurant chain. We needed a brand the could speak to all of them.</p>
    <p>Visually, our competitors were all approximating the standard Saas-startup look: cool blues, humanist sans serifs, and noun project icons. We responded to this with a primary red and blue color scheme, geometric sans serif typeface and sharp, geometric iconography. The way photography, contrast and color was applied to a given piece of collateral could set the tone to match varying audiences. Zenreach could be ’easy and approachable’, or ’robust and analytical’—depending on who we were talking to.</p><a href="documents/ZEN_Style-Guide-v6.pdf" class="download-button w-button">VIEW THE STYLE GUIDE</a>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>With the style guide in hand, the design team got to work implementing the new identity across all product, marketing and sales outlets. We commissioned a photo shoot with some local merchants. I drafted illustration guidelines and built out an extensive icon library. I worked with Sales and Marketing to design a new pitch deck, leave-behinds and other sales materials. I helped the product team design a new component library. I built animations for product loaders and video ads. I oversaw the creation of e-mail campaigns, social media content and trade show booths. And finally, we launched a new website and cross-platform marketing campaign to announce the new identity.</p>
    <p>Zenreach’s brand identity is intended to be flexible, trustworthy and utilitarian—while still maintaining a level of distinctiveness and approachability that sets it apart from competing players in the space. It’s a rule-abiding identity by design. With a small staff and changing market landscape, an easy-to-understand (and easy to replicate) visual style was crucial in building trust and responding to new challenges. Accordingly, we strived for simplicity and predictability.</p>
